<p>These are experiments conducted for the purpose of exploring various aspects of concepts I've exploring. This page will contain information on project concerning the creation of the physical aspects of terrariums, microscopy imaging, (add more here later)</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Terrariums</h2>
    <p>These are some of the terrariums that have been assembled. Terrarium 1 was created using water from the lake at Southern Illinois University of Carbondale. It is now (enter years old here) years old, and seems to go through cycles of algae and insect growth and decline. During periods of high algae growth there are a small variety of, what appear to be, copepods that flourish. The last time the algae grew and covered the walls of the container, the copepods went through a population explosion and ate all the algae from the walls. Shortly after this, they went through a population decline as a result of the loss of the food supply. This process has only actually been witnessed once during the life of the terrarium, but it must be assumed this process has been occurring to some degree or another over the lifespan of the terrarium. Observation will continue with updates in the future. (last updated 4/12/2024)</p>
